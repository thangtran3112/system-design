# 🚖 Kafka Partitioning Design for Ride-Sharing Platform

This document provides a real-world partitioning strategy for building scalable, real-time processing pipelines in a ride-sharing application using **Apache Kafka**.

## 🧱 Key Entities

| Entity       | Purpose                                 |
|--------------|------------------------------------------|
| `trip_id`    | Unique per ride or journey               |
| `driver_id`  | Identifies the driver                    |
| `rider_id`   | Identifies the passenger                 |
| `city_id`    | Location grouping for cities             |
| `zone_id`    | Finer-grained location (geo-tiles, etc.) |

## 📊 Kafka Topics and Partition Keys

| Kafka Topic          | Partition Key        | Use Case Description                                      |
|----------------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `trip-events`        | `trip_id`            | Preserve event order per trip (created → started → done) |
| `driver-location`    | `driver_id` or `zone_id` | Realtime driver GPS updates                         |
| `payment-events`     | `rider_id`           | Transaction logs per rider                               |
| `rider-activity`     | `rider_id`           | Bookings, cancellations, ride history                    |
| `city-traffic`       | `city_id`            | Aggregate traffic and surge metrics by city              |

## 🚦 Trip Events: Partitioned by `trip_id`

```json
{ "trip_id": "trip123", "event": "trip_started", "timestamp": 1710001234 }
```

Kafka ensures order within partitions. This guarantees event consistency for each trip.

---

## 📍 Driver Locations: Partitioned by `zone_id` or `driver_id`

```json
{ "driver_id": "driver42", "zone_id": "sf:5a", "lat": 37.77, "lon": -122.42 }
```

- Use `zone_id` for load-balanced processing (good for heatmaps)
- Use `driver_id` if order per driver is more important

---

## 🧪 Sample Kafka Producer Code (Python)

```python
from kafka import KafkaProducer
import json

producer = KafkaProducer(
    bootstrap_servers='localhost:9092',
    value_serializer=lambda v: json.dumps(v).encode(),
    key_serializer=lambda k: k.encode()
)

# Send a trip event
event = {"trip_id": "trip123", "event": "pickup_started", "timestamp": 1710000030}
producer.send("trip-events", key="trip123", value=event)
```

## 📈 Partition Count Planning

| Topic              | Events/sec | Suggested Partitions |
|--------------------|------------|-----------------------|
| `trip-events`      | 10,000     | 24–48                 |
| `driver-location`  | 50,000+    | 100+                  |
| `payment-events`   | 2,000      | 6–12                  |

---

## ⚠️ Partitioning Tips

- Use **high-cardinality keys** for even distribution (e.g., `trip_id`, `zone_id`)
- Avoid overpartitioning (can overload brokers and coordination)
- Use **compacted topics** for stateful updates (e.g., driver current location)

## 🧠 Sample Data Flow Architecture

```
Rider App     Driver App
   |              |
   |              |
   v              v
[ Kafka Topics (trip-events, driver-location) ]
   |
   v
[ Stream Processing (Flink, Spark, Kafka Streams) ]
   |
   +--> S3 / Data Lake
   +--> Cassandra / Redis (hot state)
   +--> ElasticSearch (searchable logs)
```
