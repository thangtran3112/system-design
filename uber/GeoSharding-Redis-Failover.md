# üåç Geo-Sharding with Redis Geospatial for User System

This guide outlines a scalable approach to designing a **geographically sharded user system**, leveraging **Redis Geospatial**, horizontal sharding, and cross-region replication. It includes strategies for latency reduction, data durability, and failover.

---

## üß≠ Goal

Design a user system where:
- User data is distributed across **geo-shards**
- Redis Geospatial is used for proximity queries
- The system supports **high availability**, **low latency**, and **durability**

---

## üß± System Components

| Component             | Role                                                 |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Redis GeoShards       | Store and query user location via geohash           |
| Load Balancer         | Routes requests based on client geolocation         |
| Geo-aware App Servers | Read/write to the nearest shard                     |
| Redis Sentinel        | Provides monitoring and automatic failover          |
| Redis AOF / RDB       | Ensures durability of geospatial data               |
| Replication Layer     | Syncs data across regions for failover              |

---

## üöÄ Approach: Geo-Sharding + Read Replicas

We **horizontally scale** by partitioning infrastructure into **geographic zones** (e.g., `us-east`, `eu-central`, `ap-south`).

### ‚úÖ Benefits:
- Lower latency for local reads/writes
- Improved fault isolation and throughput
- Scalable proximity search with Redis Geo

## üåç Architecture

```
    +----------------------+
    | Geo Load Balancer    |
    +----------+-----------+
               |
      +--------+--------+
      |  Region A (US)  |
      |  Redis + Sentinel + AOF/RDB |
      +--------+--------+
               |
      +--------+--------+
      |  Region B (EU)  |
      |  Redis + Sentinel + AOF/RDB |
      +--------+--------+
               |
      +--------+--------+
      |  Region C (Asia)|
      |  Redis + Sentinel + AOF/RDB |

## üß© Redis Geospatial Usage

```bash
GEOADD users:shard:europe 13.4050 52.5200 user:123     # Berlin
GEOADD users:shard:us-east -74.0060 40.7128 user:456   # NYC

# Radius search
GEORADIUS users:shard:europe 13.4 52.5 50 km WITHDIST
```

---

## üåê Cross-Region Failover with Redis Sentinel

Redis Sentinel monitors each regional cluster:
- If primary fails, Sentinel elects a new one
- App servers are notified of changes automatically

### Redis Sentinel Configuration

```bash
sentinel monitor shard_europe 127.0.0.1 6379 2
sentinel down-after-milliseconds shard_europe 5000
sentinel failover-timeout shard_europe 10000
sentinel parallel-syncs shard_europe 1
```

---

## üíæ Persistence with AOF / RDB

| Mode     | Purpose                                     |
|----------|---------------------------------------------|
| AOF      | Append-only file, logs every write op       |
| RDB      | Point-in-time snapshots                     |

**Recommendation:** Use **AOF + RDB hybrid mode** for both safety and performance.

```bash
appendonly yes
appendfsync everysec
save 900 1
save 300 10
```

---

## üîÅ Sharding Strategy

### Options:
- Static by region (e.g. `us-west`, `eu-central`)
- Geohash prefix (e.g., `geo:4d5z` ‚Üí shard 5)
- Consistent hashing (optional fallback)

---

## üîÑ Scatter-Gather on Boundary Crossings

For radius queries near shard edges:
1. Lookup adjacent geohash tiles
2. Query each shard in parallel
3. Merge results by distance

---

## üì¶ Replication Strategy

- **Local replication:** within region
- **Cross-region replication:** async copy to 1-2 fallback regions

```bash
# On follower node
replicaof 10.0.0.1 6379
```

|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Boundary overlap in geosearch     | Scatter-gather + merging                       |
